# React Native app built with Expo Snack

Second year University project, built with Expo Snack (https://snack.expo.io/@guldenbelli/assessment-mob-dev-app), in which I had to create a section for the "IT in the Valley" fictional magazine for users to create adverts/listings, which will then be sent to the marketing department for insertion in the magazine, just like newspaper adverts.
